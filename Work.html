            <h2>First job </h2>
            
            <hr>
            <p> For the first couple of months after coming to canada i did not work and it made me feel anxious,bored and ultimately left me feeling homesick.As most of the time
                i sat to study after a while i'd get distracted and after a certain time that additional time went into past memories and how good my life back home was compared 
                to  canada. So, during my second semester i went ahead and got a part time job at Tim Hortons. Although, it was was not that grand and only i entry level minium wage 
                job it left me satusfied enough to the point where i no longer regretted the decision of moving to canada alone and to my suprised actually started making meaning new 
                connnections with people around me.
