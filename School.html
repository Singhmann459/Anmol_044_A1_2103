            <h3>Initial Schooling</h3>
            <h4>Boarding School and daily routine</h4>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in india and my schooling till 12th grade happned in a boarding school named Kirpal Sagar Academy. Unlike most school our school was always fond of 
                extra curricular activity and was built with that in mind.During School hours we would study and after schoo we'd first have lunch and then had wait till the evening to 
                actually go out and play, where we could choose any activity from sports, horse riding or anything elsse of our choice then we'd have night time prep classes,after which
                we'd go to sleep at around 10pm. 
            </p>
            <h4>Weekends In Schooldays</h4>
            <p>
                During the weekends we'd all the time to ourself except for 3 hour session for studies that we could choose to be either on sundays or saturdays.
                Most kids were not lucky enough to have parents living nearby to visit but me it was the opposite, my home was 30 mins away i would on all weekends take my classes
                early in the morning and go home on saturday eveing and come back on Monday morning all dressed for school.
            </p>

                <h3>Move to canada</h3>
                <h4>Studyign in Lambton</h4>
            <p>
                After moving to canada the weekends becane a alot dull i'd go to school but had nothing to do the weekends and started to feel homesick,especially after my parents would
                come and visit and when they left it made me feel heartbroken. This continued through my first semester but slowly i gained confidence back in myself 
                with the help my current school i.e Lambton college i got a part time job although not in field but it was job and which made me feel fulfilled and now that i am in my last 
                semester i am somewhat relived that i came to canada for studies as it gave me exposure that no other place could have provided me back home.
